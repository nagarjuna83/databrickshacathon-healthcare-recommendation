## Inspiration
Stories of individuals unable to find the right health support inspired a push for better visibility and access to crucial services.


## What it does
AI agents that provide insights into community health, connects people to local support services (health, social, wellness), and help them navigate complicated healthcare benefits data.

## How we built it
Created parser and retreiver agents to undertsand user inputs and get releavent results from available data sets.
## Challenges we ran into
Data Relationships: Difficulty in establishing meaningful connections between datasets based on filter criteria, requiring extensive analysis and preprocessing.
ML Model Selection: Challenges in identifying the most suitable machine learning model for accurate predictions and optimized performance.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Quick understanding of datasets. End-to-end agent setup and demo.
